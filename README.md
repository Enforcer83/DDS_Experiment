# DDS_Experiment
To explore the use of Direct Digital Synthesis microchips in a waveform generator.

This project will specifically explore the AD9834 DDS produced by Analog Devices, Inc. and the AD9952 also produced by Analog Devices, Inc.

This project folder will contain all source code, schematics and layouts to implement a DDS Waveform Generator.

The source code is covered by the MIT License while the hardware (schematic and layout) will be covered by the CERN Open Hardware License (See Source and Hardware folders for the actual license).
